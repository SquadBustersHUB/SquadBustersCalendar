# Calendar 2024
This is my very first time I created something like this so it might not me perfect.
This is a simple web-based calendar application for the year 2024. It allows users to navigate through different months and view images associated with specific days.

## Features

- Navigate through different months using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- View images associated with specific days of each month.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the calendar.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the calendar.
- `css/styles.css`: CSS file containing the styles for the calendar.
- `js/script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for generating the calendar and handling user interactions.

## Calendar Data

The calendar data is stored in the `calendarData` object in the `script.js` file. It includes information about the number of days in each month, the starting day of the week, and images associated with specific days.
